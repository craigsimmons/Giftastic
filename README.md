##Game Summary##

1. Gif-ify It! Engine - Currently Branded as a generic engine to display gifs/animated gifs using Giphy.com's api.  This could be branded to generate topics around a single subject (e.g. The Wild Animal Kingdom, or Sports).

2. User begins by clicking one of the dark brown "Topic" buttons or typing a topic/subject term in the text box and hitting submit

3. The app will make an api request to giphy and return 10 random images with a rating of "G". 

4. Change # of items returned as well as rating by editing these variables. Later verion will have an admin panel to change several options

5. Clicking remove button will clear images and delete the last button/ topic from screen and topicsArr. 

6. Future releases will NOT clear images along with topic and button. Need to separate the two actions

7. Users can toggle the "state" of indiviual images... When images are first displayed, they use a "still" version. Click the image and it will animate. Click again to revert to still image.

**Release Notes:**

1. App will load initial array values and seed the display with various topic buttons.

2. Design is deliberately simple. Intend to build on this and create an automated quiz engine with database storage.

**Known issues:**

1. Not happy with responsiveness of HTML. Need to revamp and make it truly responsive.
